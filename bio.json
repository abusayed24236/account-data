  "bio": "I'm Abu Sayed — a student, a dreamer, and a creator of digital worlds. I build websites that breathe, compose music that glows in silence, and craft mobile apps that feel like portals to emotion. My journey blends code with feeling, pixels with poetry. And yes, I love someone deeply — because even in the most advanced systems, the heart remains the most powerful engine."
